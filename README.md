# What is SysUIController?
> A powerful system UI hacker (Requires ROOT, still alpha)

A powerful app lets you control system UI easily. **It is alpha now, if you have any questions, feel free to feedback. It will have more features later. (Alpha software which modifies system settings, use it as your own risk!)**

## TODO
* Add Tasker support
* Support custom profiles
* Add more settings item
* Share & export profiles
* Log to file

You tell me!

# Why not Google Play
After the day I published it to Google Play, it was been suspended from Google Play, the reson is `Device and Network Abuse`. So I think it won't be available on Google Play forever (as the same package name).

# Is it a open source project?
~Not now. Maybe I will open it later.~

Yeah, it's source are opened!
